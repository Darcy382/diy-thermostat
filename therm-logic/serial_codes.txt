Thermostat input and output:
M<int> = Thermostat mode
F<int> = Fan setting
T<long> = Thermostat time, in unix
I<int: 0 or 1> = Option to use real feel temperature 
S = Schedule, must be followed 1st by:
    H = Heat
    C = Cold
Then by:
    D = weekday
    E = weekend
Format: S<char><char>( <float hours> <float temp>)*MAX_SCHEDULED_EVENTS

Thermostat input only:
P = Pinging arduino for a return
* = Marks the end of transmission to arduino, optional, will speed up the reading
process by skipping the timeout

Thermostat output only:
e<int> = error code <int>
C( <float: temp> <float: humidity> <float: heat_idx>)*NUM_TEMP_SENSORS
R <int:heat relay state> <int:ac relay state> <int:fan relay state>

** NOTE: The parentheses used in format are only to aid with representation,
they are not included when writing data to the serial.  For example, 
S<char><char> (<float hours> <float temp>)*2 would get written to the serial as:
SHE 7.00 70 8.00 72
